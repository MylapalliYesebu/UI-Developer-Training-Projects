# ⚛️ Counter App

This is a **mini-project** built as part of the  
**[UI Developer Training Program](https://github.com/MylapalliYesebu/UI-Developer-Training-Projects.git)** (Phase 2),  
a CSR initiative of **Infosys Foundation** at **Ideal Institute of Technology**.

## 📋 Description

The **Counter App** is a simple yet effective **Angular** application designed to demonstrate core **Angular concepts** such as **components**, **data binding**, and **event handling**.

This app allows users to **increment**, **decrement**, and **reset** a counter value dynamically. It serves as a beginner-friendly project for understanding how **Angular standalone components** work and how UI updates reactively respond to state changes.
