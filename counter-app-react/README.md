# ⚛️ Counter App

This is a **mini-project** built as part of the  
**[UI Developer Training Program](https://github.com/MylapalliYesebu/UI-Developer-Training-Projects.git)** (Phase 2),  
a CSR initiative of **Infosys Foundation** at **Ideal Institute of Technology**

## 📋 Description

The **Counter App** is a simple yet effective **ReactJS** application designed to demonstrate core **React concepts** such as **state management**, **component rendering**, and **event handling**.

This app allows users to **increment**, **decrement**, and **reset** a counter value dynamically. It serves as a beginner-friendly project for understanding how **React Hooks (useState)** work and how UI updates reactively respond to state changes.
