# ⚛️ To-Do App

This is a **mini-project** built as part of the  
**[UI Developer Training Program](https://github.com/MylapalliYesebu/UI-Developer-Training-Projects.git)** (Phase 2),  
a CSR initiative of **Infosys Foundation** at **Ideal Institute of Technology**.

## 📋 Description

The **To-Do App** is a simple **ReactJS** application designed to demonstrate core **React concepts** such as **state management**, **dynamic rendering**, and **event handling**.

This app allows users to **add**, **delete**, and **mark tasks as completed**. Tasks are stored in **localStorage**, allowing them to **persist across page reloads**. This project is beginner-friendly and teaches how **React Hooks (useState, useEffect)** manage dynamic data and UI updates efficiently.
