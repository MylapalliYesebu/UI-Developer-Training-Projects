# 🧑‍🎓 Student Manager

This is a **mini-project** built as part of the
**[UI Developer Training Program](https://github.com/MylapalliYesebu/UI-Developer-Training-Projects.git)** (Phase 2),
a CSR initiative of **Infosys Foundation** at **Ideal Institute of Technology**.

## 📋 Description

The **Student Manager** is a dynamic web application designed to manage student details easily.
Users can add students with their **Name**, **Age**, and **Course**, which are displayed in a clean **table layout**.
Each record comes with **Edit** and **Delete** buttons for better data management.

This version focuses on practical CRUD-like (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, helping to strengthen DOM manipulation and UI logic skills.
