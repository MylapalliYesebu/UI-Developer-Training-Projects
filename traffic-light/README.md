# Traffic Light Simulation 🚦

This is a **mini-project** built as part of the  
**[UI Developer Training Program](https://github.com/MylapalliYesebu/UI-Developer-Training-Projects.git)** (Phase 2),  
a CSR initiative of **Infosys Foundation** at **Ideal Institute of Technology**.

## 📋 Description

The **Traffic Light Simulation** project is an interactive web application that mimics real-world traffic lights. Users can control the traffic signals using three buttons: **Stop**, **Ready**, and **Go**, which turn on the **Red**, **Yellow**, and **Green** lights, respectively. The page background color also changes to match the active signal, providing clear visual feedback.

This project is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, demonstrating **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **dynamic styling**.
